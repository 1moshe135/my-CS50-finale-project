##project background

Hello! I'm Moshe, and this is my CS-50 X finale project!
For my project, I decided to create something I've been wanting to do with a friend for quite a while. It all started when I became a programming teacher, and I didn't feel assured that I had all the tools I needed. That's when my journey began.
After a few months of learning random languages and working on basic projects, he suggested I try CS-50, and I did!
Once I completed the course, I knew exactly what to choose for this task. The kids in my classroom actually helped me with ideas for this game, and we based the characters on us and themselves.
The game features three main levels, a mini-boss, and a final boss fight. It includes all sorts of funny sounds, graphics, and different mobs with cool mechanics!

To play this game, simply press the play button. Thank you, and this marks the completion of my CS-50 journey.

recommended controls:

*to move right : D

*to move left:  A

*to jump: mouse_click

please enjoy the game and comment to share your thoughts!!
