# my CS50 finale project

* sorry if the git looks short. i spent a lot of time to write a 6 page one, but because of reloading the changes weren't saved.

## IMPORTANT!
*the game works only on non-mac computers and require keyboard!
*the assets.zip file need to be extructed before downloading the game in order for it to work!
*the game is much better with sound on! play only if you are ok with getting fraustrated >:3

## project background

Hello! I'm Moshe, and this is my CS-50 X finale project!
For my project, I decided to create something I've been wanting to do with a friend for quite a while. It all started when I became a programming teacher, and I didn't feel assured that I had all the tools I needed. That's when my journey began.
After a few months of learning random languages and working on basic projects, he suggested I try CS-50, and I did!
Once I completed the course, I knew exactly what to choose for this task. The kids in my classroom actually helped me with ideas for this game, and we based the characters on us and themselves.
The game features three main levels, a mini-boss, and a final boss fight. It includes all sorts of funny sounds, graphics, and different mobs with cool mechanics!

To play this game, simply press the play button. Thank you, and this marks the completion of my CS-50 journey.

recommended controls:

*to move right : D

*to move left:  A

please enjoy the game and comment to share your thoughts!!
